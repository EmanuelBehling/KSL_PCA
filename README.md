# KSL_PCA
A PCA that is tailored for Raman Data. The PCA code includes a number of functions that will be described later. First, a virtual environment has to be set up.

#Python setup
1. Download anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Open a command-line interface (e.g. CMD.exe Prompt or Poweshell Prompt)
3. If needed, create a new virtual environment by typing "conda create -n PCA_env python=3.10.11"
4. Activate the environment "conda activate PCA_env" (should then change from (base) to (PCA_env))
5. Install pip ("conda install pip")
6. Download and install the requirements.txt from the main page (pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt)
